Cloud Migration strategies
===================================

Migrating to the cloud is a big step, and choosing the right approach can make all the difference in your cloud journey. Here are the seven key strategies to consider when moving your workloads to the cloud:  

1. **Re-hosting (Lift and Shift)**  

This approach involves moving applications as-is from on-premises to the cloud. It’s quick and straightforward, allowing you to take advantage of cloud benefits without making major changes to your existing architecture.  

2. **Re-platforming**  

Also known as "lift, tinker, and shift," re-platforming involves making a few cloud optimizations without changing the core architecture. It’s a great middle ground for improving performance and scalability without a full refactor.  

3. **Re-purchasing**  

Sometimes, it makes sense to switch to a new, cloud-native solution rather than migrating an existing application. Re-purchasing involves replacing your current software with a SaaS solution that meets your needs.  

4. **Refactoring (Re-architecting)**  

This approach involves rethinking and redesigning your applications to fully leverage cloud capabilities. It’s more resource-intensive but can lead to significant improvements in agility, scalability, and performance.  

5. **Retiring**  

Not all workloads need to make the move to the cloud. Retiring involves identifying and decommissioning applications that are no longer needed, helping you streamline your portfolio and reduce costs.  

6. **Retaining**  

Sometimes, it’s best to keep certain applications on-premises or in a hybrid environment for the time being. Retaining involves deciding which workloads should stay where they are, often due to compliance, latency, or other considerations.  

7. **Relocating**  

This involves moving your virtual machines (VMs) from on-premises to the cloud without changing the underlying architecture. Relocating is often used when a straightforward migration of VMs is the best approach, especially when immediate cloud benefits are desired.  

The best approach often depends on the business goals, the complexity of existing infrastructure, and your long-term cloud strategy. It's important to assess your workloads carefully to choose the path that maximizes value and minimizes disruption.
