Disaster Recovery strategies
===================================

In the cloud, Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies are essential to minimize downtime and data loss. Letâ€™s take a quick look at the four most common DR strategies in AWS:  

1. **Backup & Restore**:   

Regular backups are stored offsite, and systems are restored from these backups in case of disaster.  

   - **Cost**: Low  
   - **RPO/RTO**: High (longer recovery times)  
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for non-critical systems where downtime and data loss are acceptable.  

2. **Pilot Light**:   

A minimal version of your production environment is maintained and quickly scaled up when needed.  

   - **Cost**: Moderate  
   - **RPO/RTO**: Medium  
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that need moderate availability and can handle a little downtime.  

3. **Warm Standby**:   

A partially active environment mirrors production and can take over quickly.  

   - **Cost**: Moderate to high  
   - **RPO/RTO**: Low (fast recovery)  
   - **Use Case**: Best for critical systems that need quick recovery with minor downtime tolerance.  

4. **Hot Site/ Multi-Site**:   

Fully redundant environments in multiple locations for zero downtime and data loss.  

   - **Cost**: High  
   - **RPO/RTO**: Near-zero  
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for mission-critical applications with no tolerance for downtime or data loss.  

Choosing the right strategy depends on your business needs and budget!
