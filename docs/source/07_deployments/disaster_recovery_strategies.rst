Disaster Recovery strategies
===================================

In the cloud, Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies are essential to minimize downtime and data loss. Letâ€™s take a quick look at the four most common DR strategies in AWS:  

1. **Backup & Restore**:   

Regular backups are stored offsite, and systems are restored from these backups in case of disaster.  

   - **Cost**: Low  
   - **RPO/RTO**: High (longer recovery times)  
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for non-critical systems where downtime and data loss are acceptable.  

2. **Pilot Light**:   

A minimal version of your production environment is maintained and quickly scaled up when needed.  

   - **Cost**: Moderate  
   - **RPO/RTO**: Medium  
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that need moderate availability and can handle a little downtime.  

3. **Warm Standby**:   

A partially active environment mirrors production and can take over quickly.  

   - **Cost**: Moderate to high  
   - **RPO/RTO**: Low (fast recovery)  
   - **Use Case**: Best for critical systems that need quick recovery with minor downtime tolerance.  

4. **Hot Site/ Multi-Site**:   

Fully redundant environments in multiple locations for zero downtime and data loss.  

   - **Cost**: High  
   - **RPO/RTO**: Near-zero  
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for mission-critical applications with no tolerance for downtime or data loss.  

Choosing the right strategy depends on your business needs and budget!

Some additional notes: This description responds to a very general scenario. We must take into account the following.

1. In the B&R strategy, the RPO can vary based on the frequency of backups.
2. The RTO mainly depends on factors like data size and transfer speed for every strategy.
3. In Pilot Light Strategy:

- The RPO can vary depending on how frequently data and application updates are replicated from the pilot light environment to the production environment.
- The RTO can vary depending on the time required to scale up the pilot light environment to handle production workloads.
