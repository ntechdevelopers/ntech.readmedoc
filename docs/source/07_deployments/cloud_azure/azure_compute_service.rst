Azure Compute Service
===================================

Is it confusing to choose the right Azure compute service for your app?   

Picking the right option depends on what your app needs, whether it's serverless, web hosting, or managing state. Check out the decision tree below to make it easier, and here’s a quick breakdown of the top options:  

1. **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Full control over your setup—works for any app and can handle both stateless and stateful workloads.  
2. **Azure App Service**: Ideal for apps or containers with built-in web hosting. Run multiple apps on one instance and scale up easily.  
3. **Azure Functions**: Want to go serverless? Functions automatically scale for stateless or stateful setups.  
4. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Need to manage containers? AKS is perfect for running multiple containers, both stateless and stateful.  
5. **Azure Container Apps**: Abstracted Kubernetes—perfect for running containers without Kubernetes management skills.  
6. **Azure Red Hat OpenShift**: Fully-managed Kubernetes, great for multiple containers and state management.  
7. **Azure Spring Apps**: Built for Spring-based apps with easy scaling and built-in hosting.  
8. **Azure Service Fabric**: Flexible for microservices and containers—run multiple services per VM, stateless or stateful.  
9. **Azure Batch**: Best for running scheduled, compute-heavy tasks with stateless setups.  

This decision tree will help you match your app’s needs with the right service—quick and simple
