Azure Resources
===================================

One of the best cloud providers that has huge depth of services for DevOps, Data Storage, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics and Computation. Azure cloud can have any type of technical application (microservices, functions, systems, large products, platforms or monolithic monsters) deployed using any networking subnets with various security protocols, identity access management, ingress, outgress rules, traffic policies. 
Azure also has various types of computational deployments (virtual servers, clusters, containers) on any OS (Linux, Windows) for different programming languages, frameworks (Java, Spring .Net framework, Python, Go..) and using any type of data storage and messaging queues. Storage can be non relational and relational.
Azure also provides a huge benefit on DevOps offering tools for source code management, test pipelines, deployment mechanism and boards for user stories and tasks.
