Azure Overall Network Architecture
===================================

Planning a microservices architecture on Microsoft Azure? This post dives into the essential network components that will ensure your application is secure, scalable, and highly available.

**Azure's Networking Powerhouse for Microservices:**

- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet):**  

The foundation for isolating and segmenting your network within Azure. VNets allow secure communication between microservices and, if needed, with the internet.

- **Azure Load Balancer or Azure Application Gateway:**  

Distribute traffic evenly across your services or instances.

- **Load Balancer:**  

Operates at layer 4 (TCP/UDP), perfect for general traffic distribution.

- **Application Gateway:**  

A layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) option offering advanced features like SSL termination, WAF (Web Application Firewall), and URL-based routing â€“ ideal for HTTP-based microservices.

- **Network Security Groups (NSGs):**  

Enforce security rules at the subnet or network interface level, safeguarding your microservices from unauthorized traffic.

- **Azure DNS:**  

Provides name resolution using Microsoft's infrastructure, crucial for service discovery within your microservices architecture.
