Stateful vs Stateless Design â€” What's the Difference?
===================================

Stateless design is a powerful model that has led to the development of simple yet highly scalable and efficient applications.
"State" refers to stored information that systems use to process requests. This information can change over time as users interact with the application or as system events occur.

**What are stateful applications?**

Stateful applications store data like user IDs, session information, configurations, and preferences to help process requests for a given user. A stateful design allows applications to provide a personalized experience to their users while removing the need to share data across multiple requests.

**The birth of stateless design**

As applications grew in complexity and received increasing amounts of traffic, the limitations of stateful design became apparent. Managing and maintaining session data adds significant performance overhead and complexity to a system. This complexity made it difficult for systems to scale horizontally as sharing state across multiple instances becomes a challenge.
The rapid need for scalability and efficiency drove the popularity of stateless design. Instead of having mechanisms for state management, requests contained all the information needed to process them. This allowed systems to handle high levels of requests while adding flexibility to how the system scales, making it more resource efficient.

**Key applications of stateless design**

Stateless design has been pivotal in several areas:

- **Microservices & serverless computing**: They exemplify statelessness, enabling services and functions to operate independently, thus enhancing scalability and resource efficiency.
- **RESTful APIs & CDNs**: By having each API call or request contain all necessary information, stateless design simplifies operations and improves content delivery speeds.

**Challenges of stateless design**

Despite its advantages, stateless design presents certain challenges:

- **Larger request sizes**: The need to include complete data in each request can result in increased data transfer, affecting performance.
- **Transmission inefficiencies**: Constantly sending full data sets can be less efficient than accessing centralized data in stateful designs.
- **Not always ideal**: In scenarios that inherently require state, such as complex user interactions, stateless design can add more complexity instead of simplifying the process.

**Hybrid approaches**

Most applications adopt a **hybrid approach** between stateful and stateless design depending on the needs and constraints of each component. The key to a well-designed system is balance. It should be scalable, simple, and fast without sacrificing functionality.
