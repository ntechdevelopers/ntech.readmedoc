Entity Framework Core vs Dapper
===================================

**Data Access Approach**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. It provides a high-level abstraction over the database, allowing you to work with your data using strongly-typed .NET objects. 
- Dapper: Dapper is a micro-ORM, which means it provides a lightweight, low-level, and highly efficient way to map database records to objects. It doesn't introduce a lot of abstraction.

**Performance**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework may introduce some overhead due to its high-level abstractions, change tracking, and complex query generation. However, it has improved performance compared to earlier versions. 
- Dapper: Dapper is known for its exceptional performance, as it's essentially a thin wrapper over ADO.NET. It gives you more control over SQL queries and is a good choice for scenarios where performance is critical. 

**Cases**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework is suitable for applications where rapid development and abstraction over the database are more important than raw performance. It's a good fit for enterprise-level applications with complex data models.
- Dapper: Dapper is well-suited for scenarios where performance is a top priority or when you need more control over SQL queries. It's commonly used in high-performance microservices, read-heavy applications, and when working with legacy databases. 

**Change Tracking**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework provides automatic change tracking of entities, which simplifies database updates. This can be beneficial for applications with complex data
- Dapper: Dapper doesn't offer built in change tracking, so you need to handle updates and modifications manually. This can be an advantage if you prefer explicit control over changes. 


**Code Generation**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework can generate classes and code based on your database schema, reducing the need for manual coding but potentially leading to bloated code. 
- Dapper: Dapper doesn't generate code or classes; you write your data access code explicitly, which can result in cleaner and more efficient code. 

**Control**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework abstracts most of the database operations, which can be beneficial for developers who don't want to write raw SQL. However, this abstraction can sometimes limit the control over specific queries and optimizations. 
- Dapper: Dapper gives you full control over your SQL queries. You write the SQL yourself, which can be advantageous when you need fine-grained control over the database interactions. 

**Learning Curve**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework can have a steeper learning curve, especially for beginners, due to its extensive feature set and abstractions. 
- Dapper: Dapper is relatively easy to learn and can be a good choice for developers who prefer to work with SQL directly or have experience with ADO.NET.

**Caching**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework has built-in support for caching data, which can help improve performance in read-heavy scenarios. 
- Dapper: Dapper doesn't provide built-in caching, but you can implement custom caching logic more easily since you have direct control over SQL queries. 

**Community and Ecosystem**

- Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework has a large and active community, and there are many third-party libraries and tools built around Entity Framework.
- Dapper: Dapper also has a strong community, but it may have a smaller ecosystem in comparison. However, its simplicity often means that developers can work with it effectively without relying on additional tools.
