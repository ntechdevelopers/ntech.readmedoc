SQL vs No SQL
===================================

Key Diference between Sql and NoSql database

Making the right database choice is a crucial decision for your projects. 

**SQL (Structure Query Language)**

- Structure: Tables with predefined schemas.
- Data Consistency: Strong consistency and ACID transactions.
- Scalability: Vertical scaling (add more resources to a server).
- Use Cases: Well-suited for structured data and complex queries.
- Query Language: SQL for complex queries.

**NoSQL (Not Only SQL)**

- Structure: Flexible, schema-less data models (e.g., JSON, XML).
- Data Consistency: Eventual consistency, often BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent).
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling (add more servers to a cluster).
- Use Cases: Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data, high-velocity data, and distributed systems.
- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.


**When to Choose**

- SQL: Choose for well-defined data structures, complex queries, and strong data consistency needs.
- NoSQL: Opt for flexibility, high scalability, and rapid development with evolving data requirements.
