Deploying Microservices on Azure Kubernetes Services
===================================

This architecture describes deploying a microservices application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications easy.

**The architecture consists of the following components:**

- **AKS cluster:** The AKS cluster is the foundation of the architecture. It provides the infrastructure for running the microservices application.
- **Virtual network:** The virtual network isolates the AKS cluster from the rest of the Azure network. It also provides a private network for the microservices application to communicate with each other.
- **Ingress controller:** The ingress controller is responsible for routing traffic to the different microservices in the application.
- **Azure Load Balancer:** The Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly across the nodes in the AKS cluster.
- **Azure Container Registry:** The Azure Container Registry is a private Docker registry for storing the Docker images for the microservices application.
- **Azure Pipelines:** Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that can be used to build, test, and deploy the microservices application to AKS.
- **Helm:** Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that can be used to manage the Kubernetes manifests for the microservices application.
- **Azure Monitor:** Azure Monitor collects and stores metrics, logs, and traces for the microservices application. It can be used to monitor the health of the application and troubleshoot problems.

**Deployment Process**

The following steps describe the process for deploying a microservices application to AKS using this architecture:

1. Create an AKS cluster.
2. Create a virtual network for the AKS cluster.
3. Deploy the ingress controller to the AKS cluster.
4. Create an Azure Load Balancer.
5. Create an Azure Container Registry.
6. Push the Docker images for the microservices application to the Azure Container Registry.
7. Create a Helm chart for the microservices application.
