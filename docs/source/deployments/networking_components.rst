**Networking Concepts Every Software Engineer Should Know**

As a software engineer working on product development, I once believed that networking was not a crucial part of my role. That was until the day we had to deploy our product at a customer location. They asked a seemingly simple question: How will we route the traffic from the DMZ? It was a wake-up call that not knowing about networking can lead to not-so-easy situations in the real world.  
Understanding networking is not just a theoretical exercise. It's a practical necessity when you're developing a product. Knowing how to configure and make it work under various networking architectures can save you from potential deployment headaches. If you need help understanding these, you will have a hard time.  
Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of the top 30 networking concepts that every software engineer should be familiar with.  

1. Traceroute: A network diagnostic tool that maps the path between a source and destination, showing hops and latency.  
2. Egress & Ingress: Manage outbound and inbound traffic from and to a network.  
3. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): A routing protocol for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems (AS) online.  
4. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network): Logical grouping of devices on a network, segmented for security, management, and scalability.  
5. Tunneling: Encapsulating data within another protocol to transmit across networks securely.  
6. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): A method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets.  
7. Packet Sniffing: Capturing and analyzing network packets to monitor and troubleshoot network activity.  
8. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses and network settings to devices.  
9. ACL (Access Control List): A set of rules defining permissions for accessing network resources.  
10. Proxies: Intermediary servers between clients and destinations, masking client information.  
11. Network Security Protocols: Rules and standards for securing network communication.  
12. Network Communication Protocols: Rules governing data exchange between devices on a network.  
13. MAC (Media Access Control) Address: A unique identifier assigned to network devices for communication at the data link layer.  
14. Network Topology: The physical and logical arrangement of devices and connections within a network.  
15. WAF (Web Application Firewall): A security layer protecting web applications from cyber threats and attacks.
