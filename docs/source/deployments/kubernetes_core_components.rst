Kubernetes Core Components
===================================

1. What is Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate deploying, scaling and managing containerized applications.
- It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.
- Kubernetes uses a declarative approach to configuration.
- Users define the desired state of their applications and infrastructure, and Kubernetes continuously works to maintain that state.

2. Components of Kubernetes

- **Pods**: Basic scheduling unit that holds one or more containers.
- **Nodes** :Machines (physical or virtual) in the cluster where pods are scheduled.
- **Cluster**: Collection of nodes and associated resources.
- **Kubelet**: An agent running on each node, responsible for managing the node and its containers.
- **Kubernetes Controller Manager**: Manages controllers to regulate the state of the system.
- **Kube Proxy**: Maintains network rules to allow communication between pods and external traffic.
- **etcd**: Consistent and highly-available key-value store used for all cluster data.
- **API Server**: Serves the Kubernetes API and is the primary entry point for administrative tasks.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and other constraints.
- **Controller**: Maintains the desired state of the system, such as ensuring the correct number of replicas for a particular application.
- **Service**: Provides a consistent way to access a set of pods.
- **Namespace**: A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.
- **Volumes**: Kubernetes supports various types of storage volumes, providing data persistence for pods.
- **Secrets and ConfigMaps**: Mechanisms to manage sensitive information and configuration data separately from application code.
- **Deployment**: A higher-level resource that manages updates to applications by handling the deployment and scaling of pods.
- **StatefulSets**: Manages stateful applications, ensuring stable network identities and persistent storage for pods.
- **DaemonSets**: Ensures that specific pods run on all (or specific) nodes for cluster-wide tasks like logging or monitoring.
- **Jobs and CronJobs**: Run short-lived or scheduled tasks within the cluster.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to services, typically HTTP.
- **Network Policies**: Define how groups of pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts the number of replica pods to handle varying load.
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler**: Adjusts the resources allocated to individual pods based on their usage.
- **Operators**: A way to package, deploy, and manage applications using Kubernetes APIs and controllers.
- **Kubectl**: The command-line interface to interact with Kubernetes clusters.


This is a key principle that underpins much of Kubernetes' functionality.

**Security**: 

In today's cyber landscape, security takes center stage. Leverage the power of Aqua Security and Sysdig Secure, robust container security tools, to fortify your clusters and safeguard workloads.

**Networking**:

Smooth network connectivity is the lifeblood of containerized apps. Employ Kubernetes-native solutions like Calico and Cilium to manage network policies effortlessly, ensuring seamless communication among your applications.

**Container Runtime**: 

At the core of Kubernetes lies the container runtime. Docker and other container solutions reign supreme, simplifying the management of container lifecycles and runtime environments.

**Cluster Management**:  

Streamline cluster management for scalable applications with the help of tools like Kops and Rancher. They take the complexity out of cluster provisioning and upkeep.

**Monitoring and Observability**:  

Maintain a vigilant watch over your Kubernetes environment using Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for intuitive visualization. Please remember to set up centralized logging through Fluentd or the Elastic Stack.

**Infrastructure Orchestration**:

To automate infrastructure provisioning and scaling, rely on indispensable tools like Terraform and Helm for efficient package management. They empower you to define and manage your infrastructure as code.

When combined, these tools create a robust Kubernetes ecosystem that empowers you to securely and efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.
`kubectl` is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs or troubleshoot issues. 
Whether you need to create, modify, or delete resources like pods, services, deployments, or config maps, `kubectl` provides a powerful set of commands to handle all aspects of cluster management. 
Its declarative approach to configuration means you can apply YAML manifests for consistent deployment and scaling across environments.
Beyond basic resource management, `kubectl` offers rich functionality for advanced tasks like rolling updates, scaling applications, and managing access controls.
Features like ``kubectl get``, ``kubectl describe``, and ``kubectl logs`` give users detailed insights into the state of their applications and resources. Additionally, ``kubectl exec`` lets users interact directly with containers, enabling quick debugging and real-time modifications without redeploying. Its flexible plugin architecture also allows for extending its capabilities.
