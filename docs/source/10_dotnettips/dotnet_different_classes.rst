Different Classes in .Net
===================================

**Understanding Different Classes in C#**

In C#, classes are the blueprint of objects, but not all classes are the same. Let's break down the key types of classes youâ€™ll encounter and when to use each one:  

1.  Regular Class  

Used for defining properties, methods, and events.  
When to use: For general-purpose object-oriented design where instances of the class are needed.  

2.  Static Class  

Cannot be instantiated, but useful for utility or helper methods.  
When to use: When you need a class to hold static methods that provide functionality but don't need object instances.  

3.  Abstract Class  

Cannot be instantiated directly, but meant to be inherited.  
When to use: Use when you have base functionality shared by multiple derived classes, but the base class itself is too generic to be instantiated.  

4.  Partial Class  

Allows splitting the implementation across multiple files.  
When to use: Helpful when dealing with large classes or when code is automatically generated (like with UI designers).  

5.  Sealed Class  

Cannot be inherited. Used to prevent further derivation.  
When to use: When you want to finalize a class to avoid further inheritance, often for performance or security reasons.  

6.  Record (not exactly a class, but often used for DTOs)  

Simplifies the creation of data models with immutable properties.  
When to use: Ideal for creating simple data-carrying objects where immutability and value-based equality are important.  

Each type serves a specific purpose, and knowing when to use them will make your code cleaner and more efficient.
