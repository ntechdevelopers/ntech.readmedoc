How Redis Works
==================

**How to Build Your Own Redis**

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data store that powers some of the world’s fastest and most scalable applications.  
But have you ever wondered how Redis works under the hood?  
Great engineers know the importance of understanding the internals of top technologies.  
And nothing beats practical building when it comes to learning software engineering and cracking interviews.  
It can be implemented in all popular programming languages, such as C#, Python, TypeScript, Rust, and more.  
How challenging is it? You can actually choose the difficulty level, and there are plenty of challenges available (Redis, Kafka, Git, Docker, and more).  

Pro tip: Many engineers expense this through their team’s learning budget—why not do the same?  

Let’s walk through how to build a simple Redis clone:  

1. **Implement Basic Commands**  

Start by creating responses for simple commands like PING and ECHO.  

2. **Enable Client Concurrency**  

Use threads or an event loop to handle multiple client requests at the same time.  

3. **Add Key-Value Storage**  

Implement SET and GET commands to store and retrieve key-value pairs in memory.  

4. **Implement Persistence**  

Add the ability to save and load data using RDB (Redis Database) files, so data persists across restarts.  

5. **Add Replication**  

Configure leader-follower replication to synchronize data from a primary server to replicas.  

6. **Implement Stream Commands**  

Add support for streams, allowing the server to handle time-ordered entries for real-time applications.  

7. **Implement Transactions**  

Enable multiple commands to be grouped and executed atomically in a single transaction.  

8. **Add Error Handling in Transactions**  

Handle errors in transactions, ensuring that commands execute correctly or fail gracefully.  

9. **Support Multiple Transactions**  

Extend the server to handle multiple simultaneous transactions, managing separate command queues for each client.  

This build focuses on Redis's core functionality and gives you the foundation to understand how it operates behind the scenes. While advanced features like clustering and sharding aren’t included, this build implements core functionality and provides practical insight into Redis’s speed and scalability.
