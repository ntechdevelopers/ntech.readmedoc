How CDN Works
==================

Have you ever wondered how websites load quickly no matter where you are in the world? The secret often lies in using a Content Delivery Network, or CDN.

**What is a CDN?**

A CDN is a network of distributed servers located across various geographical locations. These servers cache and deliver web content—such as images, videos, and HTML pages—to users based on their proximity to the nearest server. By doing so, CDNs reduce latency and improve the speed at which content is delivered.
For example, a website can be hosted on a server located in the USA. When a user in New York opens the site, it loads quickly. However, when a user opens the website from London, it may load more slowly due to the distance of the direct network cables. With a CDN in place, a cached version of the website's data will be located closer to London, perhaps in Dublin or Paris, allowing the website to load much faster.

**Why Use a CDN?**

- **Improved Performance**: By serving content from the closest server, CDNs significantly reduce load times.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: With multiple servers, CDNs provide redundancy, ensuring your website stays online even if one server fails.
- **Scalability**: CDNs handle high traffic volumes efficiently, making them ideal for websites that experience sudden spikes in visitors.
- **Better Security**: Many CDNs offer built-in security features like DDoS mitigation and SSL encryption.

**How Does It Work?**

1. **User Request**: A user tries to access your website.
2. **Content Routing**: The request is redirected to the CDN server nearest to the user.
3. **Content Delivery**: The CDN server delivers the cached content.
4. **Updating Content**: If the content isn't in the cache or is outdated, the CDN fetches it from the origin server, updates the cache, and serves it to the user.
