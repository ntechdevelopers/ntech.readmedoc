Load Balancing Algorithms
==================

Load balancing is the unsung hero of high-performance web applications.

1. Round Robin

Distributes requests sequentially across a list of servers, like taking turns.

2. Least Connections

Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

3. Weighted Round Robin

Similar to Round Robin but assigns weights to servers based on their capacity, directing more traffic to more powerful servers.

4. Weighted Least Connections

Combines the benefits of Least Connections and Weighted Round Robin, considering both server load and capacity.

5. IP Hash

Uses the client's IP address to consistently direct their requests to the same server.

6. Least Response Time

Directs requests to the server with the quickest response time and the lowest number of active connections.

7. Random

Assigns requests to servers randomly.

8. Least Bandwidth

Sends requests to the server consuming the least amount of network bandwidth.
