How JWT Token Works
===================================

**Why is it important?**

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

**Real-world example:**

A JWT can be compared to a digital passport.
Just as a passport contains personal information and is signed by an official authority to ensure its authenticity, a JWT contains user data and claims and is signed by the issuer to prevent tampering.
When you present a passport at border control, the officer verifies its authenticity without needing to contact the issuing country each time, much like a server can verify a JWT without needing to contact a central authority.
This makes a JWT portable and stateless, enabling it to be used across different services and applications without requiring server-side storage, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient means of authentication and authorization.

**Why JWT is Important:**

1. **Security:**  

JWTs are signed and optionally encrypted, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the data.

2. **Statelessness:**  

Unlike traditional session cookies, JWTs are stateless and do not require server-side storage.

3. **Scalability:**  

Because the server does not need to store session data, it is easier to scale horizontally.

4. **Interoperability:**  

JWTs can be used across different domains and technologies, making them versatile for various applications.

**The Token Lifecycle**

If you think managing tokens is as simple as setting them to expire, you're in for a surprise.
Let’s break down each step of the JWT lifecycle and why it matters:

- **Access Token:**  Your JWT is created with a short lifespan, e.g., 15 minutes. Every time a user accesses protected resources, the access token is sent for validation.
- **Token Expiry:**  Once the access token expires, it’s no longer valid. This limits the exposure window in case the token is compromised.
- **Refresh Token:**  It’s stored securely and used to request a new access token without forcing the user to re-authenticate. The refresh token typically has a much longer expiration, days or weeks.
- **Token Exchange:**  The server verifies the refresh token, and if valid, issues a fresh access token. This maintains session continuity, enhancing both security and user experience.
- **Token Revocation:**  If any suspicious activity is detected or the user logs out, the refresh token can be revoked. By keeping a blacklist, the server ensures that compromised tokens can’t be reused.

The result? Seamless authentication, robust security, and full control over token lifecycles.

**The Risks of Poor Token Management**

1. **No Expiration:**  

Tokens that don’t expire quickly expose the system to prolonged risk if they are stolen or compromised. Attackers could use them for extended periods.

2. **Improper Refresh Token Management:**  

If refresh tokens are not securely stored or handled, they could be intercepted, giving attackers access to generate new tokens and hijack user sessions indefinitely.

3. **No Blacklist or Revocation:**  

Without them, compromised tokens cannot be invalidated, allowing attackers to continue using them even after suspicious activity is detected.
80% of security breaches happen because tokens aren't managed properly. Think about it.
