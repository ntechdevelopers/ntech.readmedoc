SQL Optimization
===================================


1. Use Appropriate Indexes: 

Index frequently used columns in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses to speed up query execution by reducing the number of rows the database needs to scan.

2. Avoid SELECT *: 

Instead of selecting all columns with SELECT *, specify only the required columns to minimize the amount of data fetched, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

3. Optimize Joins: 

Use the most efficient join type (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.. and ensure that joining columns are indexed to speed up the join operation. Also, filter data before the join to reduce the number of rows processed.

4. Utilize Query Caching: 

Enable query caching to store the results of frequently executed queries. This can drastically reduce query execution time for repeated queries.

5. Use Appropriate Data Types: 

Choose the correct data types for columns to save storage and improve performance. For example, use INT instead of BIGINT if the data size permits.

6. Minimize Subqueries: 

Replace subqueries with JOINs or use common table expressions (CTEs. when possible, as they are often more performant and easier to read.

7. Leverage Database-Specific Functions: 

Use built-in functions and features specific to your database engine (e.g., partitioning, window functions. for complex calculations or data retrieval.

8. Monitor and Analyze Queries: 

Use tools like EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand the execution plan of your queries. Identify bottlenecks and refine the queries accordingly.

9. Avoid Unnecessary DISTINCT: 

Use DISTINCT only when necessary, as it forces the database to perform a sorting operation that can slow down query execution.
