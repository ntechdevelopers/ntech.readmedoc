Performance Tuning
===================================

**Proccess: Perf Test >> Tuning >> Retest**


**01. Code**

Code Tuning: Optimize code throughout the entire product
Optimization of code across the entire product is crucial. Leverage code profilers to identify and optimize code segments. Assess for memory leaks, CPU optimization, and resource consumption concerns.

- 1 Code Profiliers
- CPU / Memory Profiling
- Heap / Thread / Process Dump
- Frontend / Backend Code Tuning

**02. Configuration**

Config Tuning: Optimize performance through configuration tuning
Fine-tune configurations system-wide. Experiment, test, and optimize settings like Tomcat/WebLogic JDBC and thread pools. Proper configuration with optimal values is vital for overall product performance.

- Tomcat JDBC Pool
- Runtime Env Configuration Webserver Configuration
- Load Balancer Configuration
- Thread Pool Configuration
- Cache Configuration

**03. Database**

DB Tuning: Tune Database for performance
Optimizes the database by fine-tuning SQL queries, indexing, and connection pooling. Utilize tools like Oracle's AWR report for in-depth analysis and fine-tuning.

- Query Optimization
- Indexing
- Connection Pooling
- Partitioning
- AWR Report
- Data Volume Testing

**04. Infrastructure**

Infra Tuning: Hardware Benchmarking and Sizing
Benchmark hardware and instance sizes to align with the workload. Determine CPU and RAM requirements and the number of Kubernetes pods needed and ensure they meet workload and SLA expectations. This process involves planning, testing, tuning, and retesting.

- Hardware Benchmarking
- Instance Size
- Auto-Scaling
- Container Orchestration
- Storage Optimization

**05. Network**

Network Tuning: Optimizing Network Efficiency
Focuses on vital aspects in today's distributed systems, addressing issues such as DNS, protocols, latency, and firewall tuning. Optimization efforts should target effective tuning for better performance, especially when the database is situated in one region and customers are in another.

- Latency Tuning
- Traffic Prioritization
- Network Optimization
- Firewall Optimization
- DNS Optimization


**06. Architecture**

Arch Tuning: Refine architecture for better overall performance
Evaluate the architecture and consider changes such as incorporating a CDN for improved performance across various locations or implementing a queuing system to enhance performance in specific areas.

- Caching Layer 
- Loose Coupling architectural style
- Asynchronous Processing
- Communication Protocols
