Outbox pattern
===================================

**When do you need the Outbox pattern?**

The Outbox pattern is a technique for reliably publishing messages in a distributed system.
Instead of publishing messages directly, messages are stored in a database table. 
A background process then reads from that table and publishes the messages to a message broker.

**Why use the Outbox pattern?**

In distributed systems, failures are inevitable. A downstream service might be down, or the network could be unavailable.
If your application directly couples requests with notifying other services—by directly calling them or publishing messages to a queue—you introduce potential reliability issues.
The Outbox pattern ensures messages are published reliably. 

**Use case in distributed systems**

In distributed systems, multiple services often need to be updated when an event occurs.
For example:

- A user updates their profile.
- Several services must receive and process the updated data.

By using the Outbox pattern, you can ensure these updates occur reliably, even if some services are temporarily unavailable.

**Advantages**

The pattern leverages the atomic nature of database transactions. 
Messages are stored in the Outbox as part of the same transaction as the current application request, ensuring consistency.

**Considerations**

While the Outbox pattern handles the publishing side, the **consumer side** must address **idempotency** to handle retries effectively.
