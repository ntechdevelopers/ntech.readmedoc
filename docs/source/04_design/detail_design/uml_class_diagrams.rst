UML Class Diagrams
===================================


UML is a standard way to visualize the design of your system and class diagrams are used across the industry. 
 
They consist of: 
 
1. Class: Acts as the blueprint that defines the properties and behavior of an object. 
2. Attributes:Attributes in a UML class diagram represent the data fields of the class. 
3. Methods: Methods in a UML class diagram represent the behavior that a class can perform. 
4. Interfaces: Defines a contract for classes that implement it. Includes a set of methods that the implementing classes must p.vide. 
5. Enumeration: A special data type that defines a set of named values such as product category or months in a year. 
6. Relationships: Determines how one class is related to another. Some common relationships are as follows:

- Association 
- Aggregation 
- Composition 
- Inheritance 
- Implementation
