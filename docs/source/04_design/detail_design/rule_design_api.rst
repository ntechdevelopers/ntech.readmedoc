Rules Design API
===================================

✍️ **1. Meaningful Endpoints**

Align API endpoints with resources and use appropriate HTTP  verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD (Create, Read, Update,  Delete) operations. 
These verbs are fundamental to how client and  servers communicate.

✍️ **2. Versioning**

Implement API versioning to manage changes and avoid  breaking existing integrations. Consider using URL segments,  headers, or media types for versioning.

- Versioning via URLs 
- Versioning via Headers 
- Versioning via QueryStrings 
- Versioning via URLs

✍️ **3. Meaningful Responses**

Use appropriate HTTP status codes to communicate the  outcome of API requests (2xx for success, 4xx for client errors,  5xx for server errors). 

✍️ **4. Error Handling**

Design a robust error handling mechanism to provide  informative error messages and avoid exposing sensitive  information. 
HTTP Status Code:

- 2xx Success 
- 3xx Redirection 
- 4xx Client Errors 
- 5xx Server Errors 

✍️ **5. Data Validation**

Validate user input to ensure data integrity and prevent security  vulnerabilities. Consider using libraries like FluentValidation or  data annotations. 

✍️ **6. Security**

Implement security measures like authentication and  authorization to protect your API from unauthorized access. 

✍️ **7. Pagination**

Allow clients to request data in smaller chunks 
Pagination is a valuable technique for enhancing both the  user experience and developer efficiency when dealing with  large datasets in web applications and APIs.


✍️ **8. Filtering**

Filtering, in the context of data access and manipulation, refers  to the process of selecting a subset of data based on specific  criteria. 

✍️ **9. Caching**

Implement caching mechanisms to improve API performance  and reduce server load by storing frequently accessed data in  memory. 

✍️ **10. Documentation**

Provide comprehensive API documentation to help developers  understand endpoints, request and response formats, error  handling, and other important details.
