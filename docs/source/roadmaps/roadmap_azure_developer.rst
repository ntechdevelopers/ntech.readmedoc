**4 Azure Tools and Templates**

Here are some key Azure tools and templates: Azure Portal: provides a console for managing Azure resources, services, subscriptions, and accounts. 

- Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface): enables users to manage Azure resources and services from the command line. 
- Azure PowerShell: A scripting language and command-line shell for managing Azure resources using Windows PowerShell. 
- Azure SDKs (Software Development Kits): Azure SDKs are available for .NET, Java, Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, and Go. 
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates: declarative JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files used for deploying Azure resources and services. 

**5 Azure Global Infrastructure**

Azure is available in numerous geographic regions around the world, with each region containing multiple data centers (300+ data centers). 
Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. 
Azure offers a minimum of three Availability Zones in most regions. 

**6 Microsoft Azure Services**

Azure offers a wide range of cloud services (200+) including: 

- Compute 
- Storage 
- Databases 
- Networking 
- Security 
- Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
- Analytics 
- Management and governance 
- Internet of Things (IoT)

**7 Azure Virtual Machine**

- Virtual Machine is a software-based instance running on a physical server where a Guest OS has access to emulated virtual hardware using a hypervisor. 
- Virtualization: A logical division of physical computing resources like servers, storage, & network. 
- Hypervisor or VMM: A Computer software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. Understand Virtual Machine Types and Sizes. Master Virtual Machine Architecture. 
- Configure VM for deployment. 
- Understand VM Scaling: Vertical and Horizontal Scaling

**8 Azure Storage**

Designed to store and manage data for a variety of scenarios, including application data, backups, archival data, and big data analytics. 
The core services offered by Azure Storage include: 

- Blob Storage: store large amounts of unstructured data (documents, images, videos, logs, and backups).
- File Storage: provides managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 
- Queue Storage: offers a messaging service for asynchronous communication between application components or services. 
- Table Storage: provides schema-less storage of structured data.  
- Disk Storage: high-performance block storage for virtual machines and applications running in Azure

**9 Azure App Services**

A fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently. Here are some key components of Azure App Service: 

- Web Apps: supports the deployment of web applications in various programming languages such as .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP. 
- API Apps: deploy RESTful APIs and microservices, enabling integration with other applications. 
- Mobile Apps: supports mobile app development across different platforms, like iOS, Android, and Windows. 
- Logic Apps: allows users to automate workflows and business processes without requiring extensive coding or development effort. 

**10 Azure Functions**

Azure Functions allows developers to focus on writing code to handle specific tasks or respond to events, rather than managing servers or infrastructure. 
Understand Serverless Architecture as functions are based on the same. 
Familiarize with Azure Functions Architecture. Know about Azure Function Plans and Pricing. Understand Azure Function Triggers and Bindings. Create and Deploy Azure Functions. 
Implement Durable Functions that enables you to write stateful functions in a serverless compute environment. 

**11 Azure SQL Database**

Azure SQL Database allows organizations to migrate their on-premises databases to the cloud or build new cloud native applications with ease. 
Understand Database Deployment Models: Single, Elastic Pool, Managed Instance and Virtual Machine. Know about Single Database Purchasing Models: DTU and vCore. 
Familiarize with vCore Compute Tiers: Provisioned and Serverless. 
Data Migration using Data Migration Assistant (DMA) helps you to upgrade your existing database to Azure SQL Database. 

**12 Azure Messaging Service**

Messaging services facilitate asynchronous communication and integration between distributed components in the cloud and on-premises environments. 
Understand Tightly Coupled and Loosely Coupled System. 
Master messaging services provided by Azure include: 

- Azure Service Bus: enables asynchronous communication between services, and reliable message delivery via an intermediary queue. 
- Azure Event Grid: allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures. 
- Azure Event Hubs: capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second 

**13 Azure API Management**

This Enables organizations to publish, secure, manage, and analyze APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in a scalable and cost-effective manner. 
Understand the Role of APIs. 
Master API Management that is a single place for managing all your APIs. 
Know the working of API Management. 
Understand Azure API Policies. 

**14 Azure DevOps**

Provides collaborative tools and services for software development and delivery that includes version control, build automation, release management, and testing tools. Here are some key components of Azure DevOps: 

- Azure Boards: enables teams to plan, track, and manage work items, tasks, and user stories. 
- Azure Repos: a version control system that provides Git repositories for storing and managing source code, artifacts, and other development assets.
