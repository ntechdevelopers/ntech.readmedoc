API Optimization
===================================

Improving API performance can make your applications more efficient and responsive. Here are some key strategies to optimize your API:

1. Pagination: Break down large datasets into smaller, manageable pages to improve response time.
2. Async Logging: Use non-blocking logging with buffers to reduce the impact on application performance.
3. Caching: Cache frequently requested data to minimize expensive database queries and reduce response time.
4. Payload Compression: Compress data before sending to reduce bandwidth and improve data transfer speed.
5. Connection Pooling: Reuse open database connections to reduce the overhead of creating new connections for each request.

By implementing these techniques, you can significantly enhance the efficiency and speed of your APIs.
