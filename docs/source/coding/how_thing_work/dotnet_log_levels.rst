Log Levels in .NET
===================================

Effective logging is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting applications.

- **Trace**: 

Trace logs are detailed and may include sensitive data. They are disabled by default and should remain off in production.

- **Debug**: 

Debug logs are used for interactive investigation during development, useful for troubleshooting, and have no long-term value.

- **Information**: 

Information logs track the general flow of the application and should have long-term value.

- **Warning**: 

Warning logs highlight abnormal events in the application flow without stopping execution.

- **Error**: 

Error logs indicate when execution halts due to a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide issue.

- **Critical**: 

Critical logs report unrecoverable crashes or catastrophic failures needing immediate attention.

The log levels are ordered by severity.
