How to Kafka Message Works
===================================

**What is Kafka?**

Apache Kafka is a high-throughput, scalable, and fault-tolerant messaging system that facilitates communication between producers and consumers via message-based topics. It’s designed for distributed applications, ensuring high availability with automatic recovery, making it suitable for large-scale data systems. Kafka’s key components include:

1. **Kafka Broker**: A node in the Kafka cluster that stores and replicates messages.
2. **Kafka Producer**: Sends messages to Kafka topics.
3. **Kafka Consumer**: Retrieves messages from Kafka topics.

**Kafka Architecture**

Apache Kafka has four core APIs that shape its architecture:

1. **Kafka Producer API**: Allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Consumer API**: Subscribes to one or more topics and processes the stream of records produced.
3. **Kafka Streams API**: Lets applications process and transform data streams from input topics to output topics efficiently.
4. **Kafka Connector API**: Enables the creation of reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics with external systems, such as real-time database change capturing.

**Kafka Components**

Kafka’s messaging system is built upon the following components:

1. **Kafka Topic**: Kafka stores messages in Topics, which are partitioned for scalability and replicated for fault tolerance, ensuring reliability.
2. **Kafka Producer**: Publishes messages to a Kafka topic.
3. **Kafka Consumer**: Subscribes to a topic(s), reads, and processes messages from the topic(s).
4. **Kafka Broker**: Manages the storage of messages in the topic(s). A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers.
5. **Kafka Zookeeper**: Manages metadata for brokers and facilitates health checking and leadership elections.
6. **Kafka Partition**: Each partition is either a leader or a replica. The leader handles reads and writes, while replicas sync data and take over if the leader fails.

**Kafka Use Cases**

1. **Messaging**: Kafka can replace traditional message brokers due to its superior throughput, partitioning, replication, and fault tolerance.
2. **Event Sourcing**: Kafka’s ability to store large logs makes it ideal for event sourcing, capturing all changes to the application state as a sequence of events.
