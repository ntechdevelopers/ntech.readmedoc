How JWT Token Works
===================================

**Why is it important?**

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

**Real-world example:**

A JWT can be compared to a digital passport.
Just as a passport contains personal information and is signed by an official authority to ensure its authenticity, a JWT contains user data and claims and is signed by the issuer to prevent tampering.
When you present a passport at border control, the officer verifies its authenticity without needing to contact the issuing country each time, much like a server can verify a JWT without needing to contact a central authority.
This makes a JWT portable and stateless, enabling it to be used across different services and applications without requiring server-side storage, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient means of authentication and authorization.

**Why JWT is Important:**

1. **Security:**  
   JWTs are signed and optionally encrypted, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the data.

2. **Statelessness:**  
   Unlike traditional session cookies, JWTs are stateless and do not require server-side storage.

3. **Scalability:**  
   Because the server does not need to store session data, it is easier to scale horizontally.

4. **Interoperability:**  
   JWTs can be used across different domains and technologies, making them versatile for various applications.
