Dependency Injection in .Net
===================================

**Dependency Injection (DI) Life Cycles in .NET**

A Deeper Dive with Examples  

In .NET, Dependency Injection (DI) allows us to manage object creation and lifetime, which is crucial for performance and resource optimization. Here’s a breakdown of the three DI lifetimes with detailed examples of when and why to use them:  

1. **Transient:**  

- **Description:** Short-lived, a new instance is created each time the service is requested.  
- **When to use:** Perfect for stateless operations where no data needs to be retained between different requests.  
- **Example:** Imagine you have an `IEmailSenderService`. Each email sent is independent, so every time you inject this service, a fresh instance is ideal. No need to remember what emails were sent before.  
- **Real-life analogy:** Think of this as a coffee machine at a café – every time you order coffee, it brews a new cup for you.  

2. **Scoped:**  

- **Description:** Lives for the duration of a single HTTP request, shared across all components handling the same request.  
- **When to use:** Great for per-request data handling, like when managing database transactions that should be consistent within a request.  
- **Example:** In ASP.NET Core, you use `DbContext` as scoped. It ensures that during a single web request, all operations (like saving and querying data) share the same context instance, keeping things consistent and avoiding multiple database connections.  
- **Real-life analogy:** Think of a scoped service like a rental car. You use it for the entire duration of your trip, and then you return it.  

3. **Singleton:**  

- **Description:** One instance is created and reused throughout the application’s entire lifetime.  
- **When to use:** Best for services that hold global state or are expensive to create and should be reused to avoid redundant overhead.  
- **Example:** An `ICacheService` is typically singleton. Caching is meant to store data that’s accessible globally for quick lookups, and you don’t want to recreate it every time.  
- **Real-life analogy:** A singleton is like a house key – everyone in the house uses the same key to get in, no need to create a new one each time.  

Choosing the correct service lifetime in DI helps you optimize memory and resource usage, ensuring your application performs efficiently. Use Transient for lightweight, stateless services, Scoped for services with per-request data, and Singleton for globally shared resources.
