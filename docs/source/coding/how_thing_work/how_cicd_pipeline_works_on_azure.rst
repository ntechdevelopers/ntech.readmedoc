How CICD Pipeline works on Azure
=================================

**What is CI/CD?**

CI/CD, an acronym for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**, represents a holistic approach aimed at automating the integration of code changes and their seamless deployment into production. This ensures that your software is in perpetual readiness for deployment, emphasizing incremental updates over unwieldy, error-prone releases.

**How Does a CI/CD Pipeline Work?**

1. Continuous Integration (CI):

- Developers craft code and seamlessly upload it to a shared repository.

2. Continuous Deployment (CD):

- Once the code emerges unscathed from the rigorous CI phase, it's primed for deployment.

**Key Components of a CI/CD Pipeline:**

- Source Control Management (SCM): This is the digital heart where developers store their code, often utilizing Git-based repositories such as GitHub or GitLab.
- Build Tools: These are the skilled artisans that compile, package, and optimize your code for deployment. Popular options include Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI.
- Artifact Repositories: Where the precious gems of your code, like Docker images and application binaries, are safely stored for deployment.
- Deployment Tools: The automation wizards that wave their magic wands to dispatch your code to different environments, be it Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or serverless platforms.
- Testing Automation: A battalion of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests that vigilantly safeguard your code's quality and functionality.

**Benefits of CI/CD:**

- Faster Delivery: Smaller, more frequent releases mean quicker feature updates and bug fixes.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Developers can simultaneously work on different features, creating harmonious, conflict-free collaboration.
