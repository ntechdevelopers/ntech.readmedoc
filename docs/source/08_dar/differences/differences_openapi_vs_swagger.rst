OpenAPI vs Swagger
===================================

What is OpenAPI? And what is Swagger?

**Are those things the same?**

OpenAPI is a way to describe how web APIs work in a format that's easy for both people and computers to understand. 
It uses JSON Schema to explain what kind of data the API uses. 
You can make OpenAPI descriptions using simple text editing tools or special design software early on when you're just starting to build your API.

These OpenAPI descriptions are useful for several reasons. 

- Mainly, they help everyone agree on what the API is supposed to do, which helps avoid confusion later on. 
- They can also be used to automatically create help documents, fake servers for testing, and software development kits for clients to use the API more easily.
- Plus, they guide the people building both the server and the client software on how to make their parts work with the API.

**Is OpenAPI the same as Swagger?**

The question of whether OpenAPI and Swagger are the same thing is a bit tricky, and the answer is both "yes" and "no." 
OpenAPI is essentially the updated version of what used to be called Swagger, with OpenAPI 3 being the newer model following Swagger 2. 
On the other hand, when people say "Swagger," they're often talking about a set of tools, some free and some not, that are designed to work with the OpenAPI standards.
