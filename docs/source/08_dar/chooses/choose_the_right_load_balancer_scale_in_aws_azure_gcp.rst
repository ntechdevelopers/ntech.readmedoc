Choose the Right Load Balancer, Scale in AWS/Azure/GCP
===================================

Most cloud architects get it wrong.

**Application Load Balancer vs Network Load Balancer in AWS**

- **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic and are ideal for web applications. They distribute traffic based on content, enabling routing to different services based on URL paths.
Use case: ALB is used for microservices architectures where routing decisions are content-based. For example, directing traffic to different services based on API paths.
- **Network Load Balancers (NLB)**, on the other hand, operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) and are better suited for TCP/UDP traffic. They provide high-performance, low-latency distribution, suitable for heavy workloads like real-time gaming or IoT.
Use case: NLBs are ideal for latency-sensitive applications such as financial systems or multiplayer gaming platforms where high throughput is critical.

**Application Gateway vs External Load Balancer in Azure**

- **Azure Application Gateway** is a Layer 7 load balancer designed for web apps. It offers features like SSL termination, URL-based routing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF).
Use case: It's perfect for hosting multi-tier web applications, where traffic needs to be routed based on specific URL patterns or needs advanced security features like WAF to protect against OWASP threats.
- **The Azure External Load Balancer** works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) and is designed for non-HTTP workloads. It provides a simple, cost-effective solution for distributing traffic between virtual machines in a virtual network.
Use case: External Load Balancer is ideal for distributing traffic across virtual machines handling tasks like file storage or database access.

**GCP Load Balancer Types**

- In Google Cloud, **HTTP(S) Load Balancer** is the equivalent of AWS's ALB. It’s used for managing global traffic for web apps, with SSL offloading and content-based routing.
Use case: E-commerce platforms use HTTP(S) Load Balancer to direct users globally to the closest server.
- **Google’s Network Load Balancer**, like AWS’s, focuses on high-volume TCP/UDP traffic and offers low latency for backend services.
Use case: It’s used for services like large-scale VPNs or high-throughput database queries, where performance and uptime are crucial.
