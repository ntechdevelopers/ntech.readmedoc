Choose the Right IaC Tool for Managing Cloud Infrastructure
===================================

When it comes to choosing the right Infrastructure as a Code tool for managing cloud & on-prem infrastructure, there are several factors to think through:

- **Consider the Cloud Provider**: Terraform has the widest range of support for cloud providers and on-premises technologies (vSphere), followed by Pulumi and AWS CDK (designed specifically for AWS).
- **Level of Abstraction**: Pulumi and AWS CDK provide a higher level of abstraction than Terraform, which can simplify the process of defining infrastructure resources.
- **Integration with Other Tools**: Terraform and AWS CDK can be integrated with other tools such as Jenkins and GitLab, which can streamline the deployment process.
- **Considering the Learning Curve**: Terraform has a simpler syntax than Pulumi and AWS CDK (which require knowledge of specific programming languages), making it easier to get started.
- **Community Support**: Terraform has the largest and most active community, with a wide range of resources, including documentation, tutorials, and support forums. Pulumi and AWS CDK are both newer tools and may have a smaller community, but they are rapidly growing in popularity and have a range of resources available.
- **Consider Team's Experience Level**: Terraform is a good fit for teams with limited experience in infrastructure automation, while Pulumi and AWS CDK are better suited for teams with more programming experience.

OpenTofu is a great alternative to HashiCorp (after adoption of the Business Source License) and has already gained significant adoption within the open-source community and enterprise segment.

While there are similarities, OpenTofu incorporates two distinct features that are missing in the current Terraform release:

- **State Encryption**: OpenTofuâ€™s encryption mechanism allows you to encrypt both the state files and the plan files. Currently supported key providers are PBKDF2, AWS KMS, GCP KMS, and OpenBao (in beta).
- **Early Variable Evaluation**: OpenTofu lets you take advantage of variables and locals inside the terraform block and inside the module sources.
