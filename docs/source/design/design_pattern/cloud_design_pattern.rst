Cloud Design Patterns
===================================

Cloud Design Patterns -Used at Different Software Layers

**Client Layer**

- Client-side Load Balancing: Distributes requests from the client directly to the available service instances.
- State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Composite UI Pattern: Composes responses from multiple microservices to render the complete UI.

**Load Balancer Layer**

- Geographical Distribution: Routes traffic based on the geographical location of the client.
- Health Checks: Periodically checks the health of the servers and routes traffic only to healthy ones.
- Affinity Based Routing: Routes the user's request to the same server for maintaining session persistence.
- Least Connections: Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.

**API Gateway Layer**

- Backend for Frontend (BFF): Tailors API responses to the needs of individual client types.
- Circuit Breaker: Detects failures and prevents applications from trying to perform actions that are doomed to fail.
- Retry Pattern: Helps to handle transient failures when it tries to connect to a remote service or network resource.
- Request Collapsing: Collapses multiple requests for the same operation into a single request.

**Web Server Layer**

- Page Cache Pattern: Stores the output of expensive operations and reuse it to avoid duplicated work.
- Compression Pattern: Reduces the size of the response to improve load times.
- Lazy Loading: Defers initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed.
- Content Negotiation Pattern: The server generates different versions of a resource and serves the one matching the clientâ€™s criteria.

**Application Server Layer**

- Saga Pattern: Manages long-running transactions and deals with failures and compensating transactions.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Separates read and write operations to improve performance and scalability.
- Proxy Pattern: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- Chain of Responsibility: Passes the request along a chain of handlers.

**Caching Layer**

- Sidecar Caching: Deploy a dedicated cache alongside each microservice to provide isolated and scalable caching functionality.
- Cache Chaining: Arrange multiple cache layers hierarchically to handle different granularity or lifetime, querying each layer sequentially on a cache miss.
- Time-to-Live (TTL) Caching: Assigns a predefined lifespan to each cache entry, removing or refreshing the entry once its lifespan expires.

**CDN Layer**

- Prefetching: Anticipates user actions and loads resources ahead of time.
- Parallel Requesting: Makes multiple requests in parallel to improve load times.
- Edge Computing: Processes data closer to the location where it is needed.
- Domain Sharding: Splits resources across multiple domains to increase parallel downloads.
- Adaptive Image Delivery: Delivers images tailored to the device and user context.

**Database Layer**

- Sharding Pattern: Distributes data across multiple databases to improve scalability.
- Replication Pattern: Keeps copies of data in multiple locations for availability and reliability.
- Read-Replica Pattern: Uses read replicas to offload read operations from the primary database instance.
- Query Object Pattern: An object that represents a database query.
