ACID
===================================

**ACID Properties in DBMS**

1. Atomicity

- Transactions either fully succeed or fail entirely.
- It's like a light switch â€“ either everything happens, or nothing happens.

2. Consistency

- Before and after transactions, data must remain correct and valid.
- Rules and constraints ensure data stays reliable.

3. Isolation

- Multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- Each transaction is separate until it's completed.

4. Durability

- Once committed, transactional changes persist even in system failures.
- Changes are securely stored on disk.

**Advantages of ACID Properties**

1. Data Consistency

- Transactions maintain the accuracy of the database.

2. Data Integrity

- Prevents data loss or corruption by ensuring transactions are reliable.

3. Concurrency Control

- Enables many transactions to happen at once without conflicts.

4. Recovery

- Facilitates quick recovery from system failures, restoring data to a consistent state.

**Potential Drawbacks of ACID Properties**

1. Performance

- Enforcing ACID properties might slow down the system.

2. Scalability

- Large systems may struggle to handle heavy concurrency due to ACID properties.

3. Complexity

- Implementing and managing ACID-compliant systems can be challenging.
