Comprehensive Guide to API Testing Techniques
===================================

1. **Stress Testing (API Stress Testing)**

- Involves pushing APIs to their limits by simulating high loads.
- Helps identify the breaking point and potential failures under stress.
- Ensures the system can handle unexpected traffic spikes.

2. **UI Testing**

- Tests how the API integrates with the UI for end-user interactions.
- Focuses on ensuring a seamless user experience.
- Checks for consistency across various devices and platforms.

3. **Functional Testing**

- Ensures each API endpoint delivers the expected output.
- Validates input and output accuracy across different scenarios.
- Key focus: business logic and functionality of the API.

4. **Load Testing**

- Simulates normal and peak usage conditions to test API efficiency.
- Helps determine response times, throughput, and stability.
- Detects bottlenecks under regular operational loads.

5. **Integration Testing**

- Tests API integration with other modules, services, or databases.
- Ensures smooth interaction between different components.
- Focuses on data exchange accuracy between interconnected systems.

6. **Validation Testing**

- Ensures API follows the design, functionality, and performance standards.
- Checks the API’s reliability, scalability, and compliance with business rules.
- Focuses on end-to-end validation.

7. **Security Testing**

- Tests for security loopholes such as unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Assesses potential risks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Focuses on protecting sensitive data and securing API endpoints.

8. **Regression Testing**

- Ensures recent updates don’t cause errors in previously tested features.
- Runs tests to detect new bugs after modifications or enhancements.
- Maintains the stability of the API over time.

9. **Smoke Testing**

- Runs basic checks to ensure the system’s key functions work.
- Acts as a preliminary test before in-depth testing.
- Verifies that the build is stable enough for further testing.

10. **Interoperability Testing**

- Verifies that the API functions properly across different platforms and devices.
- Ensures compatibility with third-party applications and services.
- Focuses on smooth integration in varied environments.

11. **Error Detection/Runtime Testing**

- Tests the API’s ability to handle errors gracefully during runtime.
- Detects crashes, memory leaks, and performance issues.
- Focuses on error detection and robustness.

12. **Fuzz Testing**

- Inputs random or invalid data to test the API's resilience.
- Identifies potential crashes or failures when handling unexpected inputs.
- Focuses on uncovering security flaws and stability issues.
